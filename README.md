#Information
**[Semi-Completed]**

Stephen Ulibarri Multiplayer course focused on arcade shooter style gameplay, different types of weapons and power-ups 

**Multiplayer aspects postponed until the GAS course is finished/ I have a good grasp of it as it would be better to implement this course fully in GAS.
